Pomelo: A Book of Instructions and Drawings  
===========================================

**Note: Generate your own text at [http://leetusman.com/pomelo](http://leetusman.com/pomelo). I restricted it to generating 5000 words at a time to speed up page load.**

Pomelo is created for NaNoGenMo 2019, a part of [National Novel Generating Month](https://nanogenmo.github.io/), the month-long novel-generating event proposed by Darius Kazemi.

pomelo.js generates instruction or event scores, inspired by the work of pioneering fluxus and instruction artist Yoko Ono and her eponymous [Grapefruit](https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/peel-peek-touch-rub-reading-yoko-onos-grapefruit). 

I had [this idea](https://github.com/NaNoGenMo/2016/issues/22) for the 2016 NaNoGenMo but didn't complete it then. Since then it's been quietly waiting in the back of my mind.

> "The point of Grapefruit is not how you do it; it is that you do it.” *--yo*

**Note: I am currently at a stopping point but with that said there is a significant difference in quality between the original and these generated works! If I had more time for NaNoGenMo I'd probably re-work my grammar and add more sentence fragments and piece constructions from Acorn and other source texts.**

### Publisher's Note
Grapefruit was originally published in a limited edition of 500 copies by the Wunternaum Press in Tokyo in 1964.

The 1970 edition contained material from the original, and pieces and drawings done in subsequent years by Yoko Ono.

This book was generated using Lee Tusman's Pomelo, created for NaNoGenMo 2019, three years after he formulated the idea to make generated Grapefruit instruction pieces. This work was generated using Kate Compton's Tracery tool to develop the grammar and text expansion and programmed with the p5.js javascript library.
